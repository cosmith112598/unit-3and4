                I have respect for Lagerfeld as a man, but I would have so much more for him if he, in turn, respected animals.

                there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship."</i>

                     My body was becoming more womanly, it was a natural thing, and my mother wanted me to feel proud of that,
                     <br> 
                     not ashamed. Trying to steer my body away from its natural curviness would have been physically unhealthy so
