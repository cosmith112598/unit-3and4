                <i>"I am good, but not an angel. 
                    I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love."
                </i>

            <i>"I live the life of a farmer. I don't see how I could wear Lagerfeld's designs while feeding my goats.
            
                I have respect for Lagerfeld as a man, but I would have so much more for him if he, in turn, respected animals. 
            
                We do not live in the same world."</i>

            </p>
            <p><i>
                "Experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love. For a lasting union, they insist, 
                there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship."</i>

                <i>
                    "It was the impossible physical expectations that pushed me towards a more commercial trajectory.
                    
                     My body was becoming more womanly, it was a natural thing, and my mother wanted me to feel proud of that,
                     
                     not ashamed. Trying to steer my body away from its natural curviness would have been physically unhealthy so 
                     
                     instead I steered my career towards an audience who would identify with it and embrace it."

                    You have to be given what’s needed by nature, and what’s needed is to bring something new.”
